NOW as part of Ex 9, creating a conflict by editing the first line from GITHUB. This is very important documentation. You must read all of it.
Here is a new line not in the original.
This is documentation is also highly confidential. 
Leakers will be severely prosecuted.

Here is a first line added on GitHub for Ex. 9.

Here is a second line added on GitHub for Ex. 9.
Last line.

Now here is a line I am adding on BBedit. That is to say, locally. And of course this is part of Exercise Nine.

Now I am back adding yet another line in BBedit for Ex 9 because things went a bit crazy and I was trapped in the VI editor.
